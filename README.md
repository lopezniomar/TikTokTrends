# TikTok Trends & Insights Portfolio Project

For my SQL portfolio project, I created an imaginary TikTok dataset that included information on popular US content creators' niche, language spoken, location, followers, and overall likes. Using this data, I calculated each creator's engagement score and analyzed which niches and languages were most engaged with. Through my analysis, I identified trends and insights into what types of content are most successful on TikTok, which can be valuable information for marketers and content creators alike. Overall, my project showcases my proficiency in SQL and my ability to apply it to real-world scenarios.
